# Support Mr. North's Classroom

This is an independent project I've built to serve both as a fundraiser landing page for my classroom, and as an example for one of the projects my Intro and Level II Computer Science students will complete. In this project, I've used a template repository equipped with webpack, and part of the DOM is built using JS DOM Manipulation techniques, using things I learned from tab-switching log in JS.

# Thanks
